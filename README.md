## Digital Magazine Concept
The intention is to create a digital magazine that can be accessed through a QR code linked to a website. Each student will purchase a card with a QR code that links to the magazine. Scanning the QR code will provide access without the need for physical distribution.

## Login System and Key Generation
A login system may be integrated to ensure privacy and restrict access to authorized users only. This could involve Microsoft account credentials. Each QR code will generate a unique key for access, preventing unauthorized sharing. The system will ensure that each user has a specialized key.

## Privacy Concerns
The electronic version allows for better privacy management compared to physical copies, as it can limit access to students and staff.

## Website Development
The website will serve as the main platform for accessing the magazine. It will require a backend team for maintenance and functionality.

## Design Considerations
The digital magazine should be user-friendly, allowing for features like flipping pages and zooming in/out. The design should also consider color schemes suitable for both digital and print formats.

## Submission Process
There will be a submission process for magazine content, which will need to be integrated into the website.
